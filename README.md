# Jedrek's oTree folder on Be-Lab server

This repo exists to host Jedrek's oTree experiment for his BA. Below follow a few technical details, and a short description of existing projects.

## LCG

This is just an illustrative project, to check whether the server works

## Jedrek's Project

... to come ...


# oTree version and extra packages
Currently, this server is using the following:
- otree[mturk] == 2.2.4
- otree_tools # for tracking time focus
- django-recaptcha # for using google recaptchas


# Important info
1. This repo is connected to the server hosting www.be-lab.au.dk. Changes made here can be pushed to the server.
2. Pushing changes here will not immediately update the oTree version running on be-lab.au.dk. For this, oTree has to be restarted server side. Currently, the only person who has rights to do so is Simon. 

# TODO

1. Set up mTurk API credentials
2. Set up https / reverse proxy stuff
