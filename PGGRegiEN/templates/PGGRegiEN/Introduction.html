The amount you earn will depend on your decisions and the decisions of others.</span></p><p><strong>Groups&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this experiment you have been randomly assigned to a group of 5 people. Each group will remain together throughout the experiment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Rounds&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experiment will consist of 25 identical rounds and in each of these rounds you will earn money. How much depends on the choices you and the others in your group make. Once every member of the group has made the decision, you will be redirected to the results page where you can examine the behaviour of others in your group.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Income&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of each round, each of you will receive 55 units of experimental currency which we will call &ldquo;points&rdquo;, 55 points each round are called your &ldquo;income&rdquo;.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each point is worth approximately 0.065 DKK. Your income is therefore worth 3.6 DKK in each of the 25 rounds.</span></p><p><strong>Decision&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In each round, after receiving your 55 points, you may choose to keep them to yourself or to contribute some or all of them to a group project. You may contribute any amount from zero up to your entire income. Contributions higher than 55 points will not be accepted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each player in your group has the same income as you and the same decision to make.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the </span><strong>sum of the contributions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the persons in your group </span><strong>meets or exceeds</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the threshold level of </span><strong>125 points</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the group will</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">receive </span><strong>a reward </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is called a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; the value of which is </span><strong>250 points</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Everybody in the group gets an equal share of the bonus, </span><strong>that is 50 points </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(about 3.2 DKK), regardless of how much they contributed. Your total income for the period will be your initial income, plus the bonus, minus your contribution. If the </span><strong>sum of the contributions is less</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the threshold level of </span><strong>125 points,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the additional points will </span><strong>not</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be provided. In this event, </span><strong>the contributions are returned to their owners</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and your total income for the period will simply be your original income of </span><strong>55 points. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Earnings&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of your performance you will receive at least 40 DKK for your participation in this study. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on yours and others&rsquo; decisions you can make up to 170 DKK in total. Average earnings for participants are expected to be 110 DKK.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, if total contributions in your group equal 125 points or more and you have contributed X, your earnings from this round will be: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your earnings = your income (55 points; 3.6 DKK)&nbsp; &ndash; your contribution(X points ) + additional points (50 points; 3.2 DKK)&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, on the other hand, total contributions in your group equal less than 125 points and you have contributed X, your earnings will simply be your income because of the full refund rule:&nbsp; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your earnings = your income (55 points; 3.6DKK)&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your total earnings consist of the sum of your earnings from the 25 paid rounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that each token is worth approximately 0.065 DKK.</span></p><p><strong>Example A</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You contribute 26 points towards the public good. The other four players contribute a total of 97 points to the public account. The total group contribution is therefore 123 points </span><strong>and the threshold of 125 is not reached</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the points you contributed are returned. Your earnings for this round are therefore the same as your initial income, 55 points.</span></p><p><strong>Example B</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You contribute 37 points towards the public good. The other four players contribute a total of 97 points in the public good. The total group contribution is therefore more than 125, the </span><strong>threshold is reached</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the group earns a bonus of 250 points. The bonus is equally shared between all five members of the group. To compute your earnings for this round we start with your initial income, 55 points, subtract your contribution of 37 points and finally add your share of the bonus which is 50 points. Your total earnings for this round are consequently 68 points. </span></p><p><b>Do you fully understand the instructions?</b></p><div>    <button name="understand" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Yes</button>    <button name="understand" value="False" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">No</button></div>{{ form.understand.errors }}<hr> </hr>    <p> <i>Help: The option to move to the next page will become available after 3 minutes. <br>        If you have vital questions, please email the researcher (Jedrzej) at 201811497@post.au.dk<br>        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uuk3pfzmtrzsm6t/instructions%20%28final%29.pdf?dl=0" target = "_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can access and download the instructions for further reference here.</span></a> (opens in a new tab)    </i></p>{% endblock %}{% block scripts %}    <script>            setTimeout(function () {                $('.btn').show();            }, 180 * 1000);    </script>{% endblock %}{% block styles %}    <style>            .btn {                display: none;            }    </style>{% endblock %}
